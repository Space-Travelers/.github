## Hi there 👋

This is the Space Travelers Organization. 

We are currently developing an educational game as part of ESPOL Community Service project for Sagrada Familia de Nazareth School.

This project was originally part of a solution we developed for NASA Space Apps Challenge Hackathon. 

You can read more about it here: https://2021.spaceappschallenge.org/challenges/statements/the-trail-to-mars-can-you-keep-your-crew-alive/teams/space-travelers-1/project 
<!--

**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
